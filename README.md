# Identity Service

A production-ready Java Spring Boot service for account registration, authentication, session management, user profiles, and private object uploads.

## Architecture Overview

This service implements the architecture specified in `architecture.md`:

- **API Gateway**: Kong handles TLS ingress, routing, rate limiting, and request/response limits
- **Database**: PostgreSQL with Flyway migrations
- **Storage**: Amazon S3 with quarantine/clean bucket pattern for secure file uploads
- **Authentication**: Short-lived JWT access tokens (10 min) + rotating refresh tokens (30 days absolute, 7 days idle)
- **Password Hashing**: Argon2id with configurable work factors
- **MFA**: TOTP with encrypted secrets and recovery codes
- **Async Processing**: Transactional outbox pattern with leased workers
- **Observability**: Structured logging, OpenTelemetry, Prometheus metrics

## Features

### Account Management
- Email registration with verification
- Password reset workflow
- Email change workflow
- Account deletion

### Authentication
- Username/password login with Argon2id
- MFA (TOTP) with recovery codes
- JWT access tokens (asymmetric RS256)
- Refresh token rotation with replay detection
- Session management (list, revoke, revoke all)

### User Profiles
- Display name, locale, timezone
- Avatar management (linked to S3 objects)

### Object Storage
- Presigned POST uploads to quarantine bucket
- Malware scanning and image re-encoding
- Clean bucket for validated objects
- Authorized downloads with signed URLs
- Asynchronous deletion

### Security
- Rate limiting on auth endpoints
- CSRF protection for cookie operations
- Generic error responses (no account enumeration)
- Audit logging for security events
- Secure headers and CORS configuration

## Quick Start

### Prerequisites
- Java 21+
- Maven 3.9+
- Docker & Docker Compose

### Local Development

1. Start infrastructure:
```bash
docker-compose up -d
```

2. Build and run the application:
```bash
./mvnw spring-boot:run -Pdev
```

The API will be available at `http://localhost:8080/api`

### Product-specific accounts

Authentication data is isolated by `productName`. Include the configured product key in every JSON request body, for example:

```json
{
  "productName": "password-manager",
  "email": "user@example.com",
  "password": "use-a-long-unique-passphrase"
}
```

The seeded keys are `ai-log-analyser`, `password-manager`, and `document-utility`. Existing accounts are migrated under `legacy`; continue sending that key for those accounts unless they are explicitly migrated. `productName` is required and case-insensitive; the value is normalized to lowercase. The same email can register separately in each product. Access tokens carry a signed `productName` claim, and authenticated request bodies must match that claim. Requests without a body are scoped by the access token. `productName` selects an account namespace; it does not authenticate the calling application.

Product settings and email templates are stored separately for each product. Update a product's `settings` JSONB through the database administration process to override its JWT audience, `frontendBaseUrl`, verification/reset/email-change paths and TTLs, access/refresh token TTLs, MFA issuer and limits, password hashing settings, upload quotas/size/type limits, quarantine TTL, and upload/download URL TTLs. Unspecified settings continue to use deployment defaults. Product-specific email subjects and HTML bodies use the `(product_name, template_key)` key in `email_templates`.

## Configuration

### Profiles
- `dev` - Development (default)
- `prod` - Production

### Key Properties

```yaml
app:
  auth:
    jwt:
      issuer: "https://identity.example.com"
      audience: "identity-service"
      access-token-ttl: 10m
    refresh:
      absolute-ttl: 30d
      idle-ttl: 7d
    password:
      argon2-memory-kib: 65536
      argon2-iterations: 3
      argon2-parallelism: 4
  storage:
    s3:
      region: "us-east-1"
      quarantine-bucket: "identity-quarantine"
      clean-bucket: "identity-clean"
  notification:
    email:
      from-address: "noreply@example.com"
      base-url: "https://app.example.com"
```

## Testing

```bash
# Run all tests
./mvnw test -Ptest

# Run integration tests only
./mvnw verify -Ptest
```

## Building

```bash
# Build JAR
./mvnw clean package -Pprod

# Build Docker image
docker build -t identity-service:latest .
```

## Deployment

### Kubernetes
The service is designed to run as a stateless deployment with:
- Multiple replicas across availability zones
- HPA based on CPU/memory
- Pod disruption budgets
- Readiness/liveness probes

### Required Infrastructure
- PostgreSQL (managed, HA)
- Redis (for rate limiting)
- S3-compatible storage
- KMS for key management
- Kong API Gateway
- SMTP service

## Security Considerations

1. **Never expose actuator endpoints publicly** - Kong configuration restricts to internal IPs
2. **Use managed KMS/HSM** for JWT signing keys in production
3. **Enable TLS everywhere** - Kong terminates TLS
4. **Rotate secrets regularly** - Database passwords, JWT keys, encryption keys
5. **Monitor audit logs** - Alert on suspicious patterns
